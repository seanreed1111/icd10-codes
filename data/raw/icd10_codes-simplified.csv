CKD should not be coded as hypertensive if the provider indicates the CKD is not related to the hypertensioSn. The appropriate code from category N18 should be used as a secondary code with a code from category I12 to identify the stage of chronic kidney disease. See Section I.C.14. Chronic kidney disease. If a patient has hypertensive chronic kidney disease and acute renal failure, an additional code for the acute renal failure is required.

If heart failure is present, assign an additional code from category I50 to identify the type of heart failure. The appropriate code from category N18, Chronic kidney disease, should be used as a secondary code with a code from category I13 to identify the stage of chronic kidney disease. See Section I.C.14.

Assign code O13.-, Gestational [pregnancy-induced] hypertension without significant proteinuria, or O14.-, Pre-eclampsia, for transient hypertension of pregnancy. 8) Hypertension, controlled This diagnostic statement usually refers to an existing state of hypertension under control by therapy. Assign the appropriate code from categories I10-I15, Hypertensive diseases. 9) Hypertension, uncontrolled Uncontrolled hypertension may refer to untreated hypertension or hypertension not responding to current therapeutic regimen. In either case, assign the appropriate code from categories I10-I15, Hypertensive diseases. 10)Hypertensive crisis Assign a code from category I16, Hypertensive crisis, for documented hypertensive urgency, hypertensive emergency or unspecified hypertensive crisis. Code also any identified hypertensive disease (I10-I15). The sequencing is based on the reason for the encounter. 11)Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is classified to category I27, Other pulmonary heart diseases.
